 <h3>A DIET TO LAST US THE AGES</h3>
     
     <p class="bodyText">
There has long been talk over the sustainability of the food we eat. With food production and waste contributing to a third of Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG) today, degradation of our natural ecosystems and a loss of biodiversity worldwide it is imperative that action be taken.  </p>
      </p>
    
     <p class="bodyText">
In this regard I aim to answer the following: <br>

- What are the impacts of food consumption on our environment and how does this vary across different food groups? <br>

- What do diets around the world look like, what are some key trends, and how do they compare to the EAT-Lancet diet? <br>

-The correlation of consumption of different food groups with the country’s GDP per capita.

It is evident from the data above that animal-products such as meat and dairy are some of the largest contributors to environmental damage. Taking account of figures like these as well as growth in global food consumption, a group of scientists put forth the EAT-Lancet diet.

The EAT-Lancet diet aims to balance the growing population of the world while sticking to the confines of planetary boundaries and human health requirements. With the average diet varying considerably around the world it is interesting to see what each country must do to move towards this “ideal consumption”. Below is some information outlining average per capita consumption of different food groups around the world and how this compares to suggested quantities outlined by the EAT-Lancet diet.

A clear trend that can be perceived for most of the countries above is the need to reduce meat consumption and increase cereals, legumes and vegetables (plant-based items). Another interesting point is to reduce per capita calorie consumption overall. With processed foods accounting for significant proportions of diets particularly in developed countries, reducing these foods with the aim of being healthier and more sustainable will bring caloric levels down to those of the EAT- Lancet.       </p>
   
    
     <p class="bodyText">
However, another point to take notice of is Ethiopia’s per capita caloric consumption. Ethiopia, out of the countries shown above, has the lowest GDP per capita. With more prevalence of poverty, a more significant share of individuals are yet to be able to afford a nutritionally adequate diet. Below are maps showing this where a diet is deemed unaffordable if it costs more than 63% of a household's income.   </p>

Another interesting trend to observe is a country’s GDP versus the share of the diet that comes from animal-based products as well as plant-based products. 
    </p>

<p class="bodyText">
Looking at the data it can be observed that with an increase in GDP comes an increase in animal-product consumption. It also shows that with an increase in GDP, there is a fall in consumption of the very same products requiring an increase in consumption as outlined by the EAT-Lancet diet- cereals, roots and tubers. This is where the problem lies. Environmental change is driven from the top-down. The more developed and prosperous a country is the more change they can bring out and it is vital that governments act on this logic.  

</p>

 <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>

<p class="bodyText">
In conclusion the EAT-Lancet diet recommends that most countries reduce consumption of animal-based products and increase those of certain plant-based food types. The damage animal-based products have on our environment is far larger than that of plant-based foods. 
Looking at country level data the higher the GDP per capita of a country, the more the average person can alter their diet to fit that of the EAT-Lancet. With a rapidly growing population and the alarming effects of environmental damage and climate change we are beginning to witness it is key that these changes be made now.

 <h2>DATA </h2>

<p class="bodyText">
In answering the question at hand, I used two main data sources- the Food and Agricultural Organisation (United Nations) and “Our World in Data”. Particularly with the FAO dataset, I had to undergo intensive cleaning and restructuring of the datasets to achieve my desired data visualisations. I therefore used Excel and STATA to merge data and isolate years. Note that a lot of the data used is from 2017 when the EAT-Lancet diet was introduced as country-level data was less extensive the more recent the chosen year. Furthermore, for measures like emissions, 2010 data is used which may serve as a bad indicator but with the free resources available these were the most comprehensive data points I could find.  
Another obstacle I faced was sourcing APIs to support my arguments again given that I was restricted to free sources which explains the lack of API usage. Moreover, there was an overall lack of datasets at a global level addressing all food groups. Surveys and individual data for several developed countries exist with a particular emphasis on meat, fish and poultry. If I were to extend this project, looking at country-level case studies may prove to be illuminating.
